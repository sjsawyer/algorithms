# Algorithms

Personal implementations of various algorithms and data structures. All
implementations are original works, and generally strive to strike a balance
between efficiency and clarity.

Currently all algorithms are implemented in Python 2. One day perhaps I will
`%s/range/xrange/g`. But not today.

Feel free to notify me if you find any mistakes!
